I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb… Without this ’gift’ offered us by nature, we would not have survived.” But merely surviving is not enough.

Located some thirty miles west of New York City, the borough was known for its brilliant and varied gardens, farms, and greenhouses. Orchids and other blooms grown at Thomas Young Orchids and other local greenhouses were distributed in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York and were said to have been favored by Eleanor Roosevelt. Middlesex Borough explores this town's unique history from its incorporation in 1913 to the mid-1900s with vintage photographs and fascinating text. During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, residents of the westerly portion of Piscataway Township, at the urging of George Harris, decided to secede from Piscataway and form an independent town. The newly created Middlesex Borough consisted of large farms owned by the Stout, Reidy, Conover, Giles, Guernsey, and Harris families, with clusters of small homes bordering them. The Central Railroad of New Jersey passed through the town, bringing new residents to Middlesex from New York City and fostering the development of small factories and workers' houses in the Lincoln section, the housing developments of Pierce Estates and Dewey Park, and, later, the spacious homes and properties in the Beechwood Heights section of the borough.",2003.0,5.0,128.0,2.0

I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb… Without this ’gift’ offered us by nature, we would not have survived.” But merely surviving is not enough.

Located some thirty miles west of New York City, the borough was known for its brilliant and varied gardens, farms, and greenhouses. Orchids and other blooms grown at Thomas Young Orchids and other local greenhouses were distributed in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York and were said to have been favored by Eleanor Roosevelt. Middlesex Borough explores this town's unique history from its incorporation in 1913 to the mid-1900s with vintage photographs and fascinating text. During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, residents of the westerly portion of Piscataway Township, at the urging of George Harris, decided to secede from Piscataway and form an independent town. The newly created Middlesex Borough consisted of large farms owned by the Stout, Reidy, Conover, Giles, Guernsey, and Harris families, with clusters of small homes bordering them. The Central Railroad of New Jersey passed through the town, bringing new residents to Middlesex from New York City and fostering the development of small factories and workers' houses in the Lincoln section, the housing developments of Pierce Estates and Dewey Park, and, later, the spacious homes and properties in the Beechwood Heights section of the borough.",2003.0,5.0,128.0,2.0

This wise and profound book has provided thousands of readers with an answer—and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents’ expectations and win their ”love.” Alice Miller writes, ”When I used the word ’gifted’ in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in school nor children talented in a special way. I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb… Without this ’gift’ offered us by nature, we would not have survived.” But merely surviving is not enough.

Located some thirty miles west of New York City, the borough was known for its brilliant and varied gardens, farms, and greenhouses. Orchids and other blooms grown at Thomas Young Orchids and other local greenhouses were distributed in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York and were said to have been favored by Eleanor Roosevelt. Middlesex Borough explores this town's unique history from its incorporation in 1913 to the mid-1900s with vintage photographs and fascinating text. During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, residents of the westerly portion of Piscataway Township, at the urging of George Harris, decided to secede from Piscataway and form an independent town. The newly created Middlesex Borough consisted of large farms owned by the Stout, Reidy, Conover, Giles, Guernsey, and Harris families, with clusters of small homes bordering them. The Central Railroad of New Jersey passed through the town, bringing new residents to Middlesex from New York City and fostering the development of small factories and workers' houses in the Lincoln section, the housing developments of Pierce Estates and Dewey Park, and, later, the spacious homes and properties in the Beechwood Heights section of the borough.",2003.0,5.0,128.0,2.0
