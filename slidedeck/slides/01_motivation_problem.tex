\begin{frame}{Motivation and Problem}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \highlight{Growing privacy and cost concerns} with cloud-based systems
  \item Traditional systems require \highlight{user profiles and data collection}
  \item \highlight{Goal:} Build a fully offline, content-based book recommender

  \item \textbf{Research Question:}
\end{itemize}

\begin{beamercolorbox}[sep=5pt,center,rounded=true]{block title}
\footnotesize \textit{How can a local ML model recommend books based on natural language descriptions?}
\end{beamercolorbox}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Key Requirements:} No external APIs, no user tracking, semantic understanding
\end{itemize}

      [TIMING: 45 seconds - KEY TALKING POINTS:]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item "Privacy and independence concerns are growing - GDPR, data breaches, user awareness"
        \item "Traditional recommenders like Amazon collect massive user data"
        \item "My goal: prove you can do semantic recommendations locally"
        \item PAUSE after research question - let it sink in
        \item "Three key requirements guide everything I built"
      \end{itemize}
      
      \vspace{0.2cm}
      [DEFINE THESE TERMS:]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Content-based: Recommends based on item features, not user behavior
        \item Semantic understanding: Goes beyond keywords to understand meaning
        \item Local/Offline: Runs entirely on user's device, no internet needed
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    
    \begin{column}{0.49\textwidth}
      [POTENTIAL QUESTIONS:]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{"Why privacy and independence focus?"} → GDPR compliance, user control, vendor independence, cost control
        \item \textit{"What's wrong with cloud APIs?"} → Vendor lock-in, data collection, cost, dependency on enterprise software
        \item \textit{"Content vs collaborative filtering?"} → Content uses item features, collaborative uses user behavior patterns
      \end{itemize}
      
      \vspace{0.2cm}
      [TRANSITION:]
      \begin{itemize}
        \item "Let me show you the architecture I designed to achieve this..."
