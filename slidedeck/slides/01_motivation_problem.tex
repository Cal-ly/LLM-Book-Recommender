\begin{frame}{Motivation and Problem}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increasing demand for privacy-preserving, local-first ML applications.
  \item Typical recommender systems rely on cloud APIs and user profiles.
  \item Goal: explore feasibility of a fully offline, content-based book recommender system.
  \item Research question:
    \begin{quote}
    How can a local ML model be used to recommend books based on natural language descriptions?
    \end{quote}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{
  \textbf{Key Points (45 seconds):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Start with privacy motivation - very current topic
    \item Emphasize "fully offline" - no cloud APIs
    \item Research question is central - pause after reading it
    \item If asked about motivation: mention GDPR, data breaches, user control
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Potential Questions:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item "Why privacy focus?" → GDPR compliance, user trust, data breaches
    \item "What's wrong with cloud?" → Data collection, profiling, vendor lock-in
  \end{itemize}
