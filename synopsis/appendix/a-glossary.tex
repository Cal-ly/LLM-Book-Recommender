\chapter{Glossary of Terms}
\label{appendix:glossary}

This appendix defines key terms used throughout the project, with a focus on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval. Each entry aims to explain the term in accessible language, suitable for readers with a general computer science background.

\begin{description}
    \item[AI (Artificial Intelligence):] The simulation of human intelligence in machines that can reason, learn, and make decisions.

    \item[Augmentation (Data):] The process of enriching data with external sources to fill in missing values or increase its descriptive quality.

    \item[BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer):] A transformer model used for text generation and classification tasks. In this project, it powers zero-shot classification.

    \item[Category Inference:] Assigning thematic or genre labels to text entries based on their content.

    \item[Content-Based Recommendation:] A technique that recommends items based on their attributes rather than user behavior.

    \item[Embedding:] The transformation of text into a numeric vector that captures its meaning in a high-dimensional space.

    \item[FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):] A library that enables efficient vector similarity search, often used for large-scale nearest neighbor search.

    \item[Filtering:] Reducing a set of results based on certain constraints (e.g., rating threshold, genre tag).

    \item[Inference (Model):] The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

    \item[L2 Distance (Euclidean):] A metric that measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in space.

    \item[Local-First Design:] A system architecture that prioritizes local computation and storage, minimizing reliance on external servers.

    \item[MiniLM:] A lightweight sentence embedding model that provides efficient semantic representations with low computational cost.

    \item[Query:] A user-inputted string used to search or retrieve information from a system.

    \item[Recommender System:] A system that suggests items of interest to users based on various algorithms.

    \item[Semantic Search:] A search technique that considers the meaning of the query rather than just keyword matching.

    \item[Sentence Embedding:] A vector representation of a sentence that captures its semantic meaning.

    \item[Streamlit:] A lightweight Python framework for building interactive web interfaces for machine learning and data science applications.

    \item[Transformer:] A neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, commonly used in language models.

    \item[Vector Index:] A data structure that stores embedded vectors for fast similarity retrieval.

    \item[Zero-Shot Classification:] A method where a model assigns labels it has never seen during training, using semantic understanding.
