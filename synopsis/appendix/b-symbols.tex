\chapter{Symbol Dictionary}
\label{appendix:symbols}

This appendix summarizes the mathematical symbols used in the project. Each symbol is listed with its meaning and the context in which it appears.

\begin{description}
    \item[\( t \)] Input text or string to be embedded (e.g., book description or user query).

    \item[\( f(t) \)] Embedding function that maps a string to a high-dimensional vector using a pretrained model.

    \item[\( \vec{v} \)] The resulting vector embedding of the input text.

    \item[\( \mathbb{R}^{d} \)] The \(d\)-dimensional real-valued vector space in which embeddings are located. In this project, \( d = 384 \).

    \item[\( \vec{q} \)] The vector representation of a user query.

    \item[\( \vec{b}_i \)] The vector representation of the \(i\)-th book in the dataset.

    \item[\( \|\vec{q} - \vec{b}_i\|_2^2 \)] The squared L2 (Euclidean) distance between the query and a book vector, used for similarity ranking.

    \item[\( k \)] The number of top search results to retrieve based on vector similarity.

    \item[\( n \)] Total number of book entries in the vector index.

    \item[\( r \)] Pearson correlation coefficient, used to measure the linear relationship between description length and confidence.

    \item[\( \rho \)] Spearman rank correlation coefficient, used to evaluate monotonic relationships between two ranked variables.
