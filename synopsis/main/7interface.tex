\chapter{User Interface}
\label{chapter:interface}

Although not a machine learning component, the user interface (UI) enables users to interact with the system naturally and intuitively. It is implemented in \texttt{Streamlit}, a lightweight Python framework suitable for local-first applications.

\section{Design Principles}
\label{sec:ui-design}

The UI emphasizes simplicity and all inference, vector search, and filtering are executed locally.

Design goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enable concept-based, natural language search.
    \item Support filtering and sorting using metadata (rating, tags).
    \item Eliminate external dependencies, aside from optional cover lookups.
\end{itemize}

\section{Query Workflow}
\label{sec:ui-query-workflow}

Users submit free-form queries (e.g., \texttt{"Books about survival in a post-apocalyptic world"}) via a single input box.
The process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The query is embedded with the same MiniLM model.
    \item The vector is passed to FAISS to find the 60 nearest neighbors.
    \item Results are filtered and sorted.
    \item 6 book cards are shown per page.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Filtering and Sorting}
\label{sec:ui-filtering}

Users can interactively refine results using:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Genre/Tag Filter:} Multi-select from inferred categories.
    \item \textbf{Rating Sort:} Toggle ascending/descending by average rating.
    \item \textbf{Pagination:} Navigate in groups of 6 results.
\end{itemize}

Filters are applied after semantic matching.

\section{Result Display}
\label{sec:ui-display}

Each book is shown as a card with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cover Image:} Loaded from URL, with local fallback.
    \item \textbf{Title and Author}
    \item \textbf{Average Rating} as stars
    \item \textbf{Short Description} (first 300 characters)
    \item \textbf{Refined Categories}
\end{itemize}

\section{Privacy and Offline Execution}
\label{sec:ui-privacy}

The system offers full offline functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No data is collected or transmitted.
    \item No login, cookies, or tracking.
    \item Fully functional without internet access.
\end{itemize}
